# KBCNMUJAL-for Dravidian Languages in Code-Mixed Text
Identification of sentiment analysis from social media contents has more attention in past decades.
Such social media contents are code-mixed in nature and peoples find easy to express in this format.
They can bind their mother tongue with English. This task deals with identifying sentiment analysis
from code-mixed Dravidian languages. Dataset provided by organisers are in Tamil-English, Kannada-English and Malayalam-English languages. Our system uses the three different approaches viz: machine learning(MNB and DTC), neural-network(ANN and CNN) and transfer learning(BERT, mBERT). For
Malayalam-English, MNB, trained using TF-IDF found best. For Tamil-English, ANN and for KannadaEnglish CNN performed better.
